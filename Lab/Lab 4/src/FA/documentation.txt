Transition:
    - contains the next state and the rule
    - return the next state if the input matches the rule

State:
    - contains the name of the state, all transition starting form the state and if it is final or not
    - searches through all the transitions and returns the state that matches the input

FiniteAutomataRead:
    - reads the finite automata from a file and stores all the states and their transitions
