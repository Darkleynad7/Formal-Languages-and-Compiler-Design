    I have implemented 3 classes for this laboratory:
    1. HashNode:
        - contains information about a node in the hash table: key, value, hashcode and a reference to the next node

    2. HashTable:
        - a general hash table class, contains a list of nodes with its size and capacity.
        - performs basic operations like adding a key-value pair and searching a value by its key.
        - the hashing is done with the Objects.hashcode() function from Java.util

    3. SymbolTable:
        - a class that extends the HashTable class with its key being a string and its value an integer
        - the hashcode function is overridden by a new hashcode function which hashes the elements by the sum of
        the ASCII codes of their characters.
